									Mapping Food Insecurity in Karachi
								</a>
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								The onset of COVID-19 and subsequent implementation of blanket
								lockdowns across Pakistan implied large disruptions to income for
								workers in both the formal and informal sector. With many Pakistanis
								living at or near subsistence levels and dependent on daily wages,
								there were concerns that the lockdown would result in large-scale
								deprivation of basic necessities.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								In a project led by the World Bank, CERP Labs rapidly designed and
								built a dashboard to visualize data coming from automatic phone
								surveys targeting Katchi Abadis in Karachi. Indicators derived from
								waves of surveys and plotted on an interactive map showed hotspots
								in neighborhoods in which people had lost all their income, did not
								have money for a weeks worth of food supplies, and did not have
								access to free rations in their neighbourhoods.

								CERP researchers found that often the answer to the questions they
								were looking for with respect to schools attendances, enrollment,
								fee collection and grade performance was contained within dozens of
								registers maintained by the school administrators and teachers. Data
								was being recorded in these low-cost private schools, but without
								the ability for school owners to access, analyze and share it with
								parents, much of its value was lost.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								CERP Labs worked with the CERP Education researchers to build an
								application specially designed to increase the management capacity
								of low-cost private schools. Labs worked in the field to iteratively
								design and prioritize various features with school owners, admins
								and teachers, ultimately building an application which synced data
								between different school devices in real-time when online, and
								queuing changes made offline on device until internet connectivity
								returned.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								Labs formed and executed a sales strategy to sell the school
								management system in six districts of Punjab, managed a distributed
								sales team and housed a customer support center at CERP to reach
								over 300 schools in six months.

								Labs partnered with researchers in the CERP Education program to
								create a marketplace connecting low-cost schools in Pakistan with
								Education Service Suppliers. School owners are often not exposed to
								several inputs that could be critical in improving education
								outcomes in their schools, such as loans, quality textbooks, and
								education innovations in the EdTech space. By creating a digital
								marketplace which school owners were comfortable browsing and
								ordering from, it could be possible to create a sustainable
								mechanism for bringing increased choice and awareness of these
								critical education inputs.
							</div>
							<div class="segment">
								Labs piloted a one-way, and then two-way marketplace between
								low-cost private schools and education service providers with the
								creation of ilmexchange.com. Schools were able to browse a catalog
								of products even when offline, and sales coordination was done
								through a call-masking solution which protects the privacy of the
								schools while still allowing contact to take place between buyers
								and sellers. When commercial activity was depressed because of
								forced school closures in light of the COVID crisis, Labs rapidly
								built a free distance learning solution for out of school children
								to watch educational lectures curated and aligned to the Punjab
								curriculum by the CERP Education program. The rapid development of
								this feature has led to the merging of the MISchool and IlmExchange
								systems in order to better serve schools in Punjab as they emerge
								from this health crisis.
